The Chess AI Coach is an interactive application designed to analyze a player's chess games and provide personalized feedback based on performance in the opening, middlegame, and endgame phases. By leveraging data analysis, machine learning, and AI, this tool helps players identify weaknesses, understand the types of mistakes they make, and recommend targeted training materials to improve their gameplay. I hope to push this project and get more players of all levels to improve their training.
